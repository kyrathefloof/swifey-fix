# swifey-fix
Fixing a twitter slop advertisement site.

## What is swifey?
"Swifey" is this [Vercel.app](https://vercel.com/) "website" that claims to "analyze your tweets" to find your soulmate. Of course this is meant to be a meaningless app, what I don't like is how it is advertising a dating app and watermarking everything to try to get users to download their dating app. Long story short, don't use dating apps. Especially not dating apps who lie to you about what they're doing. Not cool.

## How do I implement the fix?
There are a few ways, the easiest of which is to use F12 and copy and paste the latest fix file.
You could also look into implementing this script with [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) which is this really cool chrome extension that auto-injects scripts to sites you visit for like debugging or messing around.

### I did not make this to harm anyone
I made this script with the intention to remove the lies and useless waiting this website makes you sit through. 
It is not destructive, and it does not harm any data or files in any way, shape, or form. 
The *complete* code is available on this github repository for anyone to read and modify accordingly.

To the creators of Swifey, I do not intend to harm your business. However, you shouldn't lie to your users.
Thats not cool.
I won't be taking this down unless you edit your site to be honest and remove the advertising of your dating app.
